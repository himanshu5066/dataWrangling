# Data Wrangling and Acquisition Project

## Overview
This project focuses on data wrangling and preprocessing techniques applied to a dataset. The main goal is to clean, transform, and visualize the data to prepare it for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

## Contents
- **Data Loading**: Loading the dataset into the environment.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and incorrect data types.
- **Feature Transformation**: Identification and transformation of categorical and continuous features.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizing data distributions and correlations.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Applying Pearson and Spearman correlation methods to uncover feature relationships.

## Files
- `data_wrangling.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all code for data wrangling and visualization.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For more advanced visualizations.
- **Scipy**: For statistical calculations (e.g., skewness).

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
   - `pandas`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `seaborn`
3. Open the `data_wrangling.ipynb` notebook and run all cells sequentially.

## Data Cleaning Process
- Handling missing values using appropriate strategies (drop/replace).
- Identifying categorical and continuous columns.
- Transformation of skewed data for continuous variables.

## Visualization
- Distribution plots for numerical features.
- Heatmap for correlation analysis.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the importance of data wrangling in preparing data for analysis. Proper cleaning, feature identification, and correlation insights help in creating more effective models.
